1. The main idea of this topic is based on the concept of matching and not matching 
2. When the given string value will match then we will move pointers of both strings one index back
3. When they won't match then we will simply try taking max of the answer obtained by moving one index back 
   from each string one by one 

                    abc     adc           a and a equal so move both pointers by one back
                    |       |

                    abc      adc          now b and d are different so move one pointer 
                     |        |           back for both one by one in next step



abc       adc                        abc      adc          yeah boy just like this !!
  |        |                          |         |

* here d pointer                    * here b pointer
is kept same and                    is kept same and 
pointer on b is                     pointer on d is 
moved.                              moved.


4. All the further steps will be carried out in similar fashion



IMP-> In tabulation approach we do index shifting in dp array so for getting 
    values from string we will use one index less (see the code nigga !!)
