** while working on perfect square and coin change i saw somethimg-:
    1>  While working with arrays treat the edge case e.g. if(nums==0) && if(nums<0) differently
        for if(nums==0)return 0; && for if(nums<0)return INT_MAX; handle the INT_MAX case after the function call.

    2>  But for normal loops like in perfect square first leetcode submission we can treat them as one like if(nums<=0)
        See both questions to understand the context of the shit i have written hare :).
