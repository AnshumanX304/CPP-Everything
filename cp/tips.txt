*If there is a regularly increasing or decreasing index or paramater in a 2d or 3d dp we can convert it to 1d/2d dp 
by taking an extra loop to cater that paramater inside the recursive function for recursive+memoisation approach and inside 
parent loop for tabulation approach.


* For any dp problem always look for these 4 aspects-:
    1.states
    2.transition
    3.base case
    4.final subproblem

* Cumulative sum is an important technique to solve questions related to range
